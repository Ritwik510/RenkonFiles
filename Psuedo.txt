RENKON

Pseudo Code

Header : Algorithm for Renkon.

Declarations: str(char) and val(long double) are vectors of size 25 and 15 respectively; k, num1, num2 are integer variables; A, temp1, temp2 are long double variables.



ReadCurrencies()


1.[Read Different Currencies from a file present in system ]
   
   [Currency_names consists of names of different currencies and corresponding currency numbers]
   
  Open Currency_names file for input
 
  Read from Currency_names into str

 2.[Write str values]
 
    Repeat step 3 for k <— 1 to 25
     
 3.           Write(str[k])
   
 
4.[Close file]

    Close Currency_names file
 

4.[Return to invoking routine]
    
    Return                                                  


ReadExValues()

1.[Open file]

   [Ex_Rates consists of exchange rates of about 15 countries with respect to US $]
   
   Open Ex_Rates file for input

2.[Read file values]
  
     Read from Ex_Rates into val

3.[Close file]

    Close Ex_Rates file
 

4.[Return to invoking routine]
    
    Return                                                  


CalcDisp(A, num1,num2, str)

1.[Result calculation]
   
   temp1 <— A/( str(num1))
   
   temp2 <— temp1 * str(num2)

2.[Return to invoking routine and return temp2]
    
    Return(temp2)                                               




Algorithm:

1.[Write names of different currencies and corresponding currency numbers]

    Call ReadExValues()

2.[Load Currency_names file’s content into str]
  
    Call ReadCurrencies()

3.[Read Amount]
   
   Read(A) 
  
4.[Read Currency no. of the entered amount]
   
   Read(num1)

5.[Read Currency no. of the currency to be converted to]
   
  Read(num2)

6.[Calculate result]

     result <— Call CalcDisp(A, num1, num2, str)

7.[Write result]

    Write(result)

8.Halt
